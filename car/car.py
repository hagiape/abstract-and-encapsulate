# Write a class named Car that has the following data attributes:
# • _ _year_model (for the car’s year model)
# • _ _make (for the make of the car)
# • _ _speed (for the car’s current speed)

# The Car class should have an _ _init_ _ method that accepts the car’s year model and make as arguments. 
# These values should be assigned to the object’s _ _year_model and _ _make data attributes. 
# It should also assign 0 to the _ _speed data attribute.

# The class should also have the following methods:
# • accelerate()
# The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it is called.
# • brake()
# The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
# • get_speed()
# The get_speed method should return the current speed.
